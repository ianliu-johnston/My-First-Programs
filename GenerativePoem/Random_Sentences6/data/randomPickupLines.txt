Allow me to rescue you from your crowd of admirers.
Excuse me, I just noticed you noticing me and I just wanted to give you notice that I noticed you too. 
When God made you, he was showing off. 
When I look into your eyes, it is like a gateway into the world of which I want to be a part. 
Besides being sexy, what do you do for a living?
